# Svelted CMS

Everything you need to build a fast, moderny and yet not so stable website project, powered by [`Svelte Kit`](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/tree/main/packages/create-svelte).
This project is still very new and every contribution of code will be appreciated.

Currently developed features:
> basic block build editor (can be found under the route /builder2)

## Setup project locally

First clone this repository to a place on your machine and execute the following commands for installing all packages.

```bash
# install required packages
pnpm i
```

## Developing

Done? Great, now you can install all required dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```
